# Speech and text to Sign Language

"A Django project to convert audio to sign language using NLP and web technologies."

## Project Description

This is a Django-based web application that converts speech (audio) into sign language using deep learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The main objective is to enable seamless communication between hearing and non-hearing individuals by translating spoken language into visual representations of sign language.

## Features

- Converts speech to sign language using real-time audio processing.
- Deep learning models for speech-to-text conversion and NLP integration.
- Web interface for easy interaction with the application.

## Installation Instructions

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/speech-and-text-to-sign-language.git

cd speech-and-text-to-sign-language

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Mac/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up the database
python manage.py migrate

# Run the development server
python manage.py runserver

Access the application at: http://127.0.0.1:8000/

# Usage Instructions
After successfully setting up the project and running the development server:

Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

Upload an audio file or speak directly (depending on how the system is configured).

The application will process the audio, convert it into text using speech recognition, and then translate the text into corresponding sign language representations.

View the animated signs or static sign images displayed on the screen.
